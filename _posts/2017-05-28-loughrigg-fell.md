We were staying in Ambleside for the holidays and decided to
have an adventure on Loughrigg Fell. We call it the __Lily and Ivy Walk__.
You'll find out why if you read on.

Rather than heading straight up to the summit of Loughrigg Fell with everyone
else, we climbed up some of the little crags overlooking Ambleside and Lake
Windermere and then down to __Lily Tarn__ where we skimmed some stones.
To get up to these crags you need to climb up a stone stile in the wall just by
some buildings where the main road starts to get rougher.
From Lily Tarn, we carried on up and over another crag, joining the main track
from Ambleside before having our lunch just by the the little stream crossing.
We then climbed on up __Ivy Crag__ for some amazing views over Loughrigg Tarn
and the Langdale Pikes before heading back home.

> We took photos of lots of stuff. We took photos of the village and a picture
> of me on a tree stump. It was fun!
